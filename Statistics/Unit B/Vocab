Statistical Tests: Use Data from a sample to assess a claim about a population

Null Hypothesis, H0: This is the claim that there is no effect or no difference in the Statistical data (This will always us an "=" sign)

Alternative Hypothesis, Ha: This is the claim that we are trying to find significant Statistical evidence for. (This will always use inequality signs or not equal signs)

Statistical Significance: When reults as extreme as the observed sample statistic are unlikely to occur by random change alone 
						  (assuming that null hypothesis is true), we say the sample results are Statisticaly significant.
