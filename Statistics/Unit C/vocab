Standard Error of Sample Means:
	The Larger the sample size (n) the smaller the Standard Error

Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means:
	Sample size >=30 is sufficiently large
	If the smaple is 30 or bigger than the T-distribution is going to work even if it is skewed

	center: The mean is equal to the population mean !!NOT XBAR!!

	spread: the standard error is estimated using SE = S(or sigma)/sqrt(n) where s is the S.dev of a sample.

	shape: The standardized sample means approximately follow a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.

	Even if the sample size is less than 30, a T-distribution can still be used if it is approximately normal.

Central Limit Theorem for differences in sample means:
	SE = sqrt((s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2))

	center: the mean is equal to the differences in population means

	spread: The standard error is estimated using the formula above.

	shape: The standard differences in the sample means follow a t-distribution with degrees of
	freedom approximately equal to the smaller of n1 - 1 and n2 - 1.

	Even if the sample size is less than 30, a T-distribution can still be used if it is approximately normal.


Formula for finding a 95% confidence intreval:
	Sample Stat +- Z* = CI
	Sample Stat += t* = CI

Confidence Intreval for a single mean:
	XBAR +- t* * (s/sqrt(n))

Margin of Error for a Single Mean:
	ME = t* (s/srt(n))

Determination of Sample Size to Estimate A Mean:
	n = (z* * ~o / ME)^2

T-Test for a Single Mean:
	t = (BAR-Mewnot) / (s/sqrt(n))

If the graph is not heavily skewed and there are no major outliers, you can use te t-distribution.
