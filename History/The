-- The Great Depression -- 

	In 1928 and 1929 the stock market had nearly doubled as people began to buy much more stocks than they ever have before. On October 29th, 1929, the value of the stocks started plummeting astronomically. President Hoover was a man who believed in little to no government interference in the economy, however, he eventually gave up on that and began to subsidize many of the failing businesses, including banks and railroads, this however would not be enough and he would lose to President Roosevelt in the following election. 

	A painting entitled, "Tenement Flats" depicted a poor apartment in a rich neighbor hood, that was bustling with personality. Despite the clear lack of money at this apartment, all of the people seemed to be living meaningful and happy lives. They were willing to put in the work and effort to live a happy life in these trying times.
