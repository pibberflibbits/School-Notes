WHAT TRENDS DO WE SEE ACROSS THE PERIODIC TABLE----------------

Coulomb's Law:

The force of atteaction between two particles is determined by:
		--> Magnitude of charge
		--> Distance Between Particles

---------------------------------------------------------------

Higher charge means stronger attractive force.
Smaller distance means stronger attractive force. (Kinda like gravity!)
