WHAT TRENDS DO WE SEE ACROSS THE PERIODIC TABLE----------------
---------------------------------------------------------------


Coulomb's Law:

The force of atteaction between two particles is determined by:
		--> Magnitude of charge
		--> Distance Between Particles

---------------------------------------------------------------

Higher charge means stronger attractive force.
Smaller distance means stronger attractive force. (Kinda like gravity!)

As we move from left to right on the periodic table the Atomic Radius Decreases.
As we move from left to right on the periodic table the Ionization energy increases.
As we move down the periodic table the Atomic Radius increases
As we move down the periodic table Ionization Energy increases
