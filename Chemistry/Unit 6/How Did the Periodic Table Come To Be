QOD: The periodic table that we created was easy to read, and resulted in 
relatively accurate results, but was too simple and did not supply enough information.

MENDELEEV'S PERIODIC TABLE 

	* Mendeleev was able to predict elements that had not yet been discovered
	  with shocking accuracy.

	* Arranged the elements by mass, but some elements seemed out of order.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODERN PERIODIC TABLE

	* GROUPS/FAMILIES
		--> Vertical Columns
	
	* PERIODS
		--> Horizontal Rows

PERIODIC LAW: Elements in the same group have chemical properties in common.
