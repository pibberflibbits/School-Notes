HOW DO WE USE MOLES TO COUNT ATOMS?---------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS:
	Multipily by conversion factors to isolate the needed unit
	Molar Mass = Mass of 1 mol of a substance.	
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	If you have a unit that you love, put that unit up above
	If you have a unit that's got to go, put that unit down below

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1 mole = 6.02*10^23 
	
	GRAM TO # OF PARTICLE CONVERSIONS:
		We know that moles can be used to count atoms/ Always convert to moles in-between.
