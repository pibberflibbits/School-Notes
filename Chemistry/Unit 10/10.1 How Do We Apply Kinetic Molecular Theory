------------------------------10.1 HOW DO WE APPLY THE KINETIC MOLECULAR THEORY---------------------------------

KINETIC MOLECULAR THEORY (KMT) (FOR GAS PARTICLES):
	1) PARTICLES ARE IN CONSTANT RANDOM MOTION
	2) THEY COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER AND EITHER REACT OR BOUNCE
	3) THEY HAVE NO INTER MOLECULAR FORCES.

IDEAL VS REAL GASES:
	--> REAL GASESA HAVE MOST LIKE "IDEAL" GASES WITH THEY ARE AT LOW P & HIGH T.
	--> PRESSURE + VOLUME ARE INVERSELY RELATED
	--> BOTH PRESSURE + VOLUME ARE DIRECTLY RELATED
	--> UP=CONSTANT =/= V/T = CONSTANT

COMBINED GAS LAW:

P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2

P = PRESSURE
V = VOLUME
T = TEMPERATURE (K)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MEASURING PRESSURE: 

PRESSURE IS MEASURED IN TORR, MILLIMETERS OF MERCURY, KILOPASCALS, OR ATMOSPHERES.

MEASURING VOLUME: 

ONE MOLE OF ANY GAS WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME VOLUME (22.4 L) AT STP, NO MATTER THE GASS

(0.00916)(2,800) / 33 = (0.00916)(X) / 273
