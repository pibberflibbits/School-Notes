---------------------------------------------- 10.3 WHAT IS ENTHALPY -------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES ENERGY HAVE TO DO WITH BONDS?
	--> IT TAKES ENERGY TO BREAK BONDS, AND ENERGY IS RELEASED WHEN A BOND IS FORMED.
	--> ENERGY IS RELEASED WHEN BONDS ARE FORMED
	--> BONDS ARE BROKEN + FORMED IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS
	--> ENDOTHERMIC REACTIONS ABSORB ENERGY OVERALL (ENERGY IN) 
	--> EXOTHERMIC REACTIONS RELEASES ENERGY OVERAL (ENERGY EXITS)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTHALPY (CHANGE IN HEAT): OVERALL AMOUNT OF HEAT ENERGY ABSORBED OR REALESED IN A REACTION.

ENTHALPY = PE PRODUCTS - PE REACTANTS
		PE = POTENTIAL ENERGY

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+DELTA-H = ENDOTHERMIC (PRODUCTS @ HIGHER ENERGY THAN REACTANTS)
-DELTA-H = EXOTHERMIC (REACTANTS @ HIGHER ENERGY THAN PRODUCTS)

EXOTHERMIC REACTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN ENDOTHERMIC ONES.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES ADDING A CATALYST DO? 
	--> ADDING A CATALYST LOWERS THE ACITVATION ENERGY.
	--> THIS SPEEDS UP THE REACTION BUT DELTA-H REMAINS UNCHANGED.
