-------------------------------- 10.4 WHAT IS LE CHATELIER'S PRINCIPLE --------------------------------

EQUILIBRIUM:
	--> REACTIONS CAN GO FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS

	--> EQUILIBRIUM OCCURS WHEN FORWARD AND REVERSE REACTIONS ARE OCCURING AT THE SAME RATE.

	--> AT EQUILIBRIUM, THE RATIO OF CONCENTRATION OF THE REACTANTS TO PRODUCTS REMAINS CONSTANT.

	--> EQUILIBRIUM CAN BE CHEMICAL

	--> EQUILIBRIUM CAN BE PHYSICAL
			EX: FREEZING POINT, WHEN T = 0C, THE RATE OF FREEZING = RATE OF MELTING.

LE CHATELIER'S PRINCIPLE: 
		A SYSTEM WILL UNDERGO CHANGES TO REDUCE STRESS (ANY CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE, CONCENTRATION, OR PRESSURE) 
		TO RE-ACHIEVE EQUILIBRIUM
