----------------------------------10.2 WHAT ARE THE FACTORS AFFECTING REACTION RATE-------------------------------

KINETICS
	--> REACTIONS DONT ALWAYS HAPPEN
	--> THEY ONLY HAPPEN WHEN ORIENTATOIN AND ENERGY OF THE COLLIDING PARTICLES ARE CONDUCIVE.

FACTORS AFFECTING REACTION RATE
	1) NATURE OF REACTANTS

		--> STRONGER BONDS ARE SLOWER TO BREAK

	2) SURFACE AREA

		--> THE MORE SURFACE AREA, THE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFECTIVE COLLISIONS

	3) CONCENTRATION (AMOUNT) OF THE REACTANTS

		--> THE MORE REACTANTS, THE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFECTIVE COLLISIONS

	4) PRESSURE

		--> NO EFFECT ON SOLIDS OR LIQUIDS
		--> REALLY AFFECTS GASES! HIGHER P = MORE COLLISIONS.

	5) TEMPERATURE

		--> HIGHER T LEADS TO MORE COLLISIONS & MORE EFFECTIVE COLLISIONS.

	6) CATALYSTS

		--> THEY DECREASE THE ACTIVATION ENERGY FOR A REACTION TO PROCEED BY PROVIDING AN EASIER PATHWAY
		--> THEY ARE NOT REACTANTS OR PRODUCTS (THEY DON'T GET USED UP)
