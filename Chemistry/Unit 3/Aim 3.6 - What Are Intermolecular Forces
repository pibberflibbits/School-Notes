-- WHAT ARE INTERMOLECULAR FORCES -- 
----------------------------------------

Intermolecular Force: Attraction between molecules.

-------------------------------------------------------
Types of Intermolecular Force
-------------------------------------------------------

1) Dipole (Die-Pole) Force:
	An Intermolecular Force between polar molecules

2) Hydrogen Bond:
	A super strong Dipole force between a hydrogen in one polar molecule and a Flourine,
	Oxygen or Nitrogen in another polar molecule.
	(A HYDROGEN BOND IS NOT AN ACTUAL BOND, IT IS AN INTERMOLECULAR FORCE)

3) Weak Intermolecular force (Aka "London Dispersion Forces")
	Weak Intermolecular Force occurs between nonpolar molecules with momentary dipoles.
